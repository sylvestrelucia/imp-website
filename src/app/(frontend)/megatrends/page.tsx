              Each company in our portfolio must demonstrate direct revenue exposure to one or more of these six megatrends. Rather than following index composition, we build a high-conviction portfolio that reflects our forward-looking thematic convictions.

              We believe that investing through the lens of these megatrends not only aligns capital with positive change, but also positions investors to capture asymmetric growth in a complex and rapidly evolving global economy.
